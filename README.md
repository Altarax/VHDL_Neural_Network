# VHDL_Neural_Network
A complete neural network to learn two things : training a neural network in Python and creating it in VHDL.

## TODO :
- [] Create a neural network in Python
- [] Train the neural network in Python
- [] Create a neural network in VHDL :
    - [] Create the neuron
    - [] Simulate neuron and validate
    - [] Create the activation function
    - [] Simulate activation function and validate
    - [] Create the layer
    - [] Simulate layer and validate
    - [] Create the neural network (TOP LEVEL)
    - [] Simulate TOP LEVEL 
- [] Make everything automatised :
    - [x] Convert floating point to fixed point
    - To write
