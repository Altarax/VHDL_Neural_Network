# VHDL_Neural_Network
A complete neural network to learn two things : training a neural network in Python and creating it in VHDL.

## TODO :
- [] Create a neural network in Python
- [] Train the neural network in Python
- [] Create a neural network in VHDL :
    - [] Create the neuron
    - [] Create the activation function
    - [] Create the layer
    - [] Create the neural network (TOP LEVEL)
    - [] Simulate everything 
- [] Make everything automatised :
    - [] Convert floating point to fixed point
    - [] Generate bus_arrays with a and b parameters
    - [] Generate the network according to the given parameters
