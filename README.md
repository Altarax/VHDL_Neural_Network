# VHDL_Neural_Network
A complete neural network to learn two things : training a neural network in Python and creating it in VHDL.

## TODO :
- [x] Create a neural network in Python
- [x] Train the neural network in Python
- [x] Create a neural network in VHDL :
    - [x] Create the neuron
    - [x] Create the layer
    - [x] Create the activation function
    - [x] Create the neural network (TOP LEVEL)
    - [x] Simulate everything 
- [x] Make everything automatised
